# Valentine's Day Invitation 💖

A playful, interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to ask someone to be your Valentine. 

## Features
- **Dynamic Interaction:** The "No" button triggers a sequence of increasingly sad GIFs and persuasive messages.
- **Scaling Logic:** Each time "No" is clicked, the "Yes" button increases in size to encourage a positive response.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with CSS Flexbox to ensure a centered and clean layout across devices.
- **Asset Management:** All media assets are organized in a dedicated directory for clean pathing and deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Layout, custom animations, and transitions.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: DOM manipulation and event-driven logic.
